What is RISE?
-------------
As you know... we love **Jupyter/IPython** and we like **Reveal.js** too.

Previously, we developed a "converter" for the `nbconvert` library to
export a ``ipynb`` file to a *STATIC* html slideshow based in **Reveal.js** library.

But with RISE, you don't have a *STATIC* version anymore, you have a **LIVE**
version! A notebook **rendered** as a **Reveal.js**-based slideshow,
where you can **execute** code or show to the audience whatever you can show/do
inside the notebook itself (but in a "slidy" way).
